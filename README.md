BlindNav
==================

Our group's submission for Oxford University's 2014 Hackathon 'OxHack'

Allows for the blind to navigate the web by utilizing Google's image captioning machine learning algorithm. Using voice, the app reads back a generated (using machine learning) caption of any photo the mouse points to.
